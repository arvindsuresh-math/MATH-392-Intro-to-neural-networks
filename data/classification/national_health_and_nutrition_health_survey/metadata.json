Though expansive, the dataset is often too broad for specific analytical purposes. In this sub-dataset, we narrow our focus to predicting respondents' age by extracting a subset of features from the larger NHANES dataset. These selected features include physiological measurements, lifestyle choices, and biochemical markers, which were hypothesized to have strong correlations with age.", "area": "Health and Medicine", "tasks": ["Classification"], "characteristics": ["Tabular"], "num_instances": 6287, "num_features": 7, "feature_types": ["Real", "Categorical", "Integer"], "demographics": ["Age", "Gender"], "target_col": ["age_group"], "index_col": ["SEQN"], "has_missing_values": "no", "missing_values_symbol": null, "year_of_dataset_creation": 2019, "last_updated": "Fri Nov 03 2023", "dataset_doi": "10.24432/C5BS66", "creators": ["NA NA"], "intro_paper": {"ID": 304, "type": "NATIVE", "title": "A data-driven approach to predicting diabetes and cardiovascular disease with machine learning", "authors": "An Dinh, Stacey Miertschin, Amber Young, S.
