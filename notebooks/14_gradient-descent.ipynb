Since $\\call$ is the average of the sample loss $L(w; x,y)$ over all samples $(x,y) \\in \\cald$, this is equivalent to requiring that the sample loss $L(w; x,y)$ be differentiable with respect to $w$. This holds in all the examples we have seen so far, including linear regression with MSE, logistic regression with BCE, and softmax regression with CCE."

    "### Gradient descent algorithm\n",
    "Putting it all together, the gradient descent algorithm is (broadly speaking) as follows:\n",
    "1. Initialize the parameters $w$ to some random values and choose a learning rate $\\alpha$ (some small real number).\n",
    "2. Compute predictions $\\hat{y}$ for the dataset $\\mathcal{D}$ using the current parameters $w$.\n",
    "3. Compute the loss $\\call$ for the dataset $\\mathcal{D}$ using the current parameters $w$.\n",
    "4. Compute the gradient $\\nabla_w \\call$ of the loss with respect to the parameters.\n",
    "5. Update the parameters using the formula $w \\leftarrow w - \\alpha \\nabla_w \\call$.\n",
    "6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the loss converges to a minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, there are variations of the gradient descent algorithm that are used to improve convergence speed and stability:\n",
    "1. **Batch gradient descent**: In this version, we compute the gradient $\\nabla_w \\call$ using the entire dataset, update the parameters, and iterate in this way. This is the most straightforward implementation of gradient descent, but it can be slow for large datasets.\n",
    "2. **Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)**: In this version, we compute the gradient using only a single instance from the dataset at each iteration, i.e. we compute each sample gradient $\\nabla_w L(w;x,y)$, update the weights, then move to the next sample and iterate in this way (once we finish one loop over the whole dataset, we repeat until we are satisfied with our loss). This can lead to faster convergence, but it can also be noisy and lead to oscillations in the loss function.\n",
    "3. **Mini-batch gradient descent**: This is a compromise between batch and stochastic gradient descent. In this version, we compute the gradient using a small random subset (mini-batch) of the dataset at each iteration (i.e. we average the sample gradients in the mini-batch). This can lead to faster convergence and more stable updates.\n",
    "4. **Momentum**: This is a technique that helps accelerate gradient descent in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations. It does this by adding a fraction of the previous update to the current update.\n",
    "5. **Adaptive learning rates**: This is a technique that adjusts the learning rate during training based on the progress of the optimization. This can help improve convergence speed and stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark.**\n",
    "Note that if we define the **sample gradient** as the gradient of the sample loss $L(w; x,y)$ with respect to $w$, i.e.\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    \\nabla_w L = \\nabla_w L(w; x,y) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\, \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_1} & \\dotsb & \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_p} \\, \\end{bmatrix},\n",

    "This is an equality of row vectors in the parameter space $\\R^p$. Later, we will need to work with more general \"shapes\" of parameters, namely, we will have matrices of parameters.

    "## Computing $\\nabla_w \\call$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory and practice\n",
    "The gradient descent algorithm is powerful, but computing the gradient for many iterations can become very expensive (in terms of both time as well as memory). This is especially true when training on massive datasets, or when the model is complex (with many parameters), both of which hold in the case of deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, an *efficient* implementation of gradient descent is needed. To understand what this entails, there are two components:\n",
    "1. (Theoretical) We use the **chain rule** to break down our gradient computation into a number of intermediate steps. That is, we break up the function $\\call$ into a number of smaller functions, each of which is \"easy\" to differentiate, and then we apply the chain rule to appropriately multiply and add the intermediate derivatives to obtain the final product $\\nabla_w \\call$.\n",
    "2. (Practical) We need to minimize the computational and memory cost of the intermediate derivatives; this is accomplished by using a smart algorithm called **backpropagation**, which basically ensures that any intermediate derivative is computed only once and reused as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark.** \n",
    "If you look up backpropagation on the internet, you will often find comments saying that \"it is just the chain rule\". This is flat out wrong:\n",
    "- The chain rule is a mathematical theorem that tells you how to compute the derivative of a composition of functions. It is \"simply\" an equation relating certain derivatives with certain sums and products of (intermediate) derivatives. \n",
    "- Backpropagation, on the other hand, is an algorithm that computes all the ingredients appearing in the chain rule in a particular order, stores them for re-use, and then combines them according to the chain rule to culminate in the final quantity $\\nabla_w \\call$. Thus, it can be understood as a particular \"clever\" implementation of the chain rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is devoted to understanding the chain rule and where it comes from. The practical implementation of backpropagation is postponed until later. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main issue with the chain rule is not so much the conceptual understanding of it, but rather the notation, which can quickly pile up and turn into a confusing mess. We will sidestep this issue by systematically using the formalism of differentials."
