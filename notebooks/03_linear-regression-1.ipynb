    "$$S_1 \\times \\dotsb \\times S_n = \\{ (x_1,\\dotsc,x_n) \\mid x_i \\in S_i \\textup{ for } i=1,\\dotsc,n \\}.$$\n",
    "The reason for the \"$\\times$\" notation is that if each $S_i$ is a finite set (of size $|S_i|$), then the size of the direct product is the product of the sizes: $$|S_1 \\times \\dotsb \\times S_n| = |S_1| \\times \\dotsb \\times |S_n|.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## The space $\\mathbb{R}^n$\n",
    "The real line is denoted $\\mathbb{R}$, and sometimes, $\\mathbb{R}^1$. The notation $\\mathbb{R}^n$ represents the direct product of $\\mathbb{R}$ with itself $n$ times:\n",

    "When we want to do arithmetic with points in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, such as addition and multiplication, it becomes appropriate to consider them as **vectors**.

    "- **Columns.**  The columns of $X$ are vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^m$; each column $\\mathbf{v}_j$ corresponds to the feature $X_j$. The last column $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ corresponds to the target. We often summarize this info by writing\n",

    "## Measuring the error\n",
    "Recall that our **loss function** is a function of the parameters that measures how \"good\" the predictions of the model are *on our train set*. To measure the errors of our predictions, we can follow a general schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each instance $i=1,\\dotsc,m$, compute the difference $\\epsilon_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i$, and compute the error as some function of $\\epsilon_i$.\n",
    "2. Average the errors over all instances to get the *mean error per instance*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive first attempt would be to take $\\epsilon_i$ itself as our for each instance. However, this would be problematic, since positive and negative errors could cancel each other out. To avoid this, we want the errors to all be non-negative. Thus, there are two natural choices for the error function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** The error for the $i$-th instance is $|\\epsilon_i| = |y_i - \\hat{y}_i|$. Geomtrically, this is simply the distance between the actual and predicted values on the target axis. Averaging over the instances $i=1,\\dotsc,m$, we get the MAE:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\textup{MAE}(\\mathbf{w})    & = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m |\\epsilon_i|\\\\\n",

    "                                & = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m |y_i - \\mathbf{x}_i^T \\mathbf{w}|.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** The error for the $i$-th instance is $(\\epsilon_i)^2 = (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$. Geomtrically, this is the square of the distance between the actual and predicted values on the target axis. Averaging over the instances $i=1,\\dotsc,m$, we get the MSE:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\textup{MSE}(\\mathbf{w})    & = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\epsilon_i^2\\\\\n",
    "                                & = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\\\\\n",

    "## Comparing MSE and MAE\n",
    "There a couple key differences between MAE and MSE:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sensitivity to outliers.** The MSE is more sensitive to outliers than the MAE. This is because the MSE squares the errors, so that large errors are penalized more heavily. Similarly, errors less than $1$ are made even smaller when squared, resulting in the distribution on the right: lot's of values clustered near $0$, and long tail of outliers. In contrast, the MAE treats all errors equally, leading to a more spread out distribution of errors.\n",
    "2. **Differentiability.** The MSE (considered as a function of the parameters $\\mathbf{w}$) is differentiable everywhere, while the MAE is not differentiable at zero. This means that the MSE can be minimized using calculus, while the MAE cannot. This is a key reason why the MSE is more commonly used in practice, because for large datasets, the optimization algorithms used to minimize the loss function (namely, the method of gradient descent) require differentiability!"

    "## Displacement vectors\n",
    "Vectors should usually be thought of as arrows starting at the origin. Very often, it is useful to visualize vectors with different starting points. When the starting point is not the origin, we refer to these as *displacement vectors*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"displacement\" arises because displacement vectors naturally arise in the context of physics: if an object starts at a point $P = (a_1,\\dotsc,a_n)$ and ends at $Q = (b_1,\\dotsc,b_n)$, then the displacement of the object is given by the displacement vector \n",

    "## Distance between points\n",
    "The **norm** or **magnitude** of a vector $\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\; v_1 & \\dotsb & v_m \\; \\end{bmatrix}^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ is simply its length. The formula for the length is a generalization of the Pythagorean Theorem:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",

    "Given points $P = (a_1,\\dotsc,a_m)$ and $Q = (b_1,\\dotsc,b_m) \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, the *distance* between $P$ and $Q$ is defined to be the norm of the displacement vector $\\vec{PQ}$:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    \\textup{Distance between $P$ and $Q$ } = ||\\vec{PQ}|| = \\sqrt{ \\sum_{i=1}^m (b_i -a_i)^2 }.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "Treating $P$ and $Q$ as vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$, we note that the distance is related to the dot product by the formula\n",

    "**Remark.** The distance formula above is sometimes called the *Euclidean norm* or *L2 norm*. There are other norms that can be used to measure the length of a vector. The most common ones are:\n",

    "- **$L_1$-norm:** \n",
    "This is the sum of the absolute values of the entries:\n",
    "$$||\\mathbf{v}||_1 = |v_1| + \\dotsb + |v_m|.$$ \n",
    "This is also called the *Manhattan norm* or *Taxicab norm* because it measures the distance between two points in a city if you can only travel along the grid of streets.\n",
    "- $L_{\\infty}$**-norm:** \n",
    "This is the maximum of the absolute values of the entries: $$ ||\\mathbf{v}||_{\\infty} = \\max \\{|v_1|,\\dotsc,|v_m|\\}. $$  \n",
    "This is also called the *supremum norm* or *maximum norm*.\n",

    "## Linear combinations\n",
    "Vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ in the same space $\\mathbb{R}^m$ can be added to give a new vector $\\mathbb{u}+\\mathbb{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$; the addition is done coordinate-wise.

    "\n",
    "Given a scalar $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we can scale $\\mathbf{v}$ by $\\lambda$ to get a new vector $\\lambda\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$. Given vectors $\\mathbf{v}_1,\\dotsc,\\mathbf{v}_n,\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, we say that $\\mathbf{y}$ is a *linear combination$ of the $\\mathbf{v}_i$'s if there exist scalars $c_1,\\dotsc,c_n \\in \\mathbb{R}$  such that\n",

    "Recall that our augmented design matrix $\\overline{X}$ has $n+1$ columns $\\mathbf{v}_0,\\dotsc,\\mathbf{v}_n \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, where the first column $\\mathbf{v}_0$ is the \"all-$1$'s\" vector $\\mathbf{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$.
