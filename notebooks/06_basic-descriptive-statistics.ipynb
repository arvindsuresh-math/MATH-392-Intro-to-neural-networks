The tendency of a data to cluster around a central value can be measured in a few different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample mean**: This is the average of all the values in the sample. It is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values. Thus, if there are $m$ instances $x_1,\\dotsc,x_m$ comprising a column vector $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ (assuming these are numerical values), the sample mean is $$\\overline{\\mathbf{x}} = \\frac{1}{m} (\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{1}) = \\frac{1}{m} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^m x_i \\right).$$ However: \n",

NOTE: Sometimes, the categorical variable is encoded as a number (typically integer, as in the case of wine quality), in which case we may refer to is as an \"ordinal variable\". In this case, the mean is defined, but it is not exactly meaningful (unless the categories are ordered, in which case it is meaningful).\n",
    "- **Sample median**: This is the middle value of the sample when it is sorted in ascending order. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean, making it a more robust measure of central tendency in some cases. However:\n",
    "    - The median does not factor in the actual values, only the order of the values. This means that two variables with very different distributions can have the same median, simply because they have the same middle value.\n",
    "    - The median is not defined for categorical variables. However, it is defined for ordinal variables, in which case it may be meaningful.\n",
    "- **Mode**: This is the most frequently occurring value in the data. A dataset can have multiple modes (bimodal, trimodal, etc.) or no mode at all. The mode is useful for categorical data where we wish to know which is the most common category. However, this measure doesn't mean anything for continuous variables, since they are unlikely to have repeated values. \n",

    "### Probability density functions (PDF)\n",
    "Suppose now that we have a continuous variable $X$ with $\\textup{supp}(X) = \\mathbb{R}$ (for simplicity). In this case, the subset $S$ of the support that we are interested in will typically be an interval $[a,b]$ (or open interval $(a,b)$; it does not matter). Thus, our naive definition of probability would lead to the following definition:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\tag{1}\n",
    "\\begin{alignedat}{1}\n",
    "    \\textup{Pr}(X \\in [a,b]) & = \\textup{Pr}(a \\leqslant X \\leqslant b)\\\\\n",

    "\\end{alignedat}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "This definition can lead to strange results; the key point is that our dataset will have only finitely many instances ($m$, say), so any interval $[a,b]$ which does not contain any of the values that we see will be assigned a probability of $0$. This is not what we want, since it is possible that $X$ could take a value in $[a,b]$ even if we don't see any values in that interval. Indeed, when we plot a histogram, the taller the bar, the more likely it is that we will see a value in that interval, so choosing an interval inside that bar should result in a non-zero probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this complication, we basically need to correctly adapt the \"discrete\" set-up in the case of categorical variables to a \"continuous\" set-up for continuous variables. That is, instead of a PMF, we seek a **probability density function** (PDF), which is a function $$p_X: \\textup{supp}(X) \\to [0,\\infty)$$ such that for any interval $[a,b] \\subset \\textup{supp}(X)$, we have\n",

    "    \\textup{Pr}(X \\in [a,b]) = \\int_a^b p_X(x) dx. \n",

    "Thus, we can think of the PDF as a \"continuous\" version of the PMF: in the discrete case, the probability that $X$ lies in a subset $S$ is given by summing over the probability masses of each value in $S$. In the continuous case, the probability that $X$ lies in an interval $[a,b]$ is given by *continuously summing* (i.e. integrating) the probability densities over all values in the interval. \n",

    "So, how do we obtain the PDF? Or at least, how do we obtain an approximation of the PDF? \n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is to view the histogram as an approximation of the PDF. In fact, the bins of the histogram should be thought of as the rectangles in a Riemann sum that approximates the area under the curve of the PDF. As we decrease the width of the bins, the histogram will (in theory) converge to the PDF. (Of course, ironically enough, if we decrease the bin-width too much then we will not have enough data to fill the bins, and the histogram will be very noisy.)"

For example, we can use three different colors to denote the possible classes of wine quality in the histogram of the alcohol content. In `seaborn`'s `histplot` function, we can use the `hue` parameter to color the histogram bars according to the target class, and we can choose the color palette using the `palette` parameter.
