    "- We discuss Lagrange's interpolation theorem on finding polynomials that interpolate a set of points in the plane.\n",
    "- We discuss polynomial regression, which is a method of fitting a polynomial to a set of points in the plane.\n",
    "- We discuss the bias-variance tradeoff in regression problems, and discuss the concept of over-fitting and under-fitting. "
